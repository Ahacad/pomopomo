### Motivation

I am a busy developer, but at the same time I also want to know *why* am I busy, so as to improve productivity. Am I procrastinating on one task? Am I not concentrated when doing some job? The *pomodoro* way of working is awesome, but with the ability to record and analyze detailed time usage I could be further more productive.
